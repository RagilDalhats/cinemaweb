            <p>A beautiful and kind-hearted girl named Ella and her wealthy parents live happily in a large house with a few servants, until her mother falls ill and later dies. Ella promises to follow her mother's last wish: to have courage and be kind. Years later, Ella's father marries widowed Lady Tremaine, who has two unpleasant daughters, Drisella and Anastasia. Ella's father leaves on business, and Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, forcing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move into the attic. When Ella's father unexpectedly dies, Lady Tremaine fires the household staff to save money, and forces all of their chores upon Ella. Seeing Ella's face covered in cinders after sleeping by the fireplace, her step-family mockingly dubs her "Cinderella"..</p>
